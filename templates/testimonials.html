      "Thanks to Hear Me Code, I'm learning Python and working on two projects for work. I also learned to be comfortable using the terminal and GitHub, which allowed me to finally finish my personal website. ... I can ask as many questions as I want knowing that I wonâ€™t be judged!"

      "Hear Me Code is not just a place I go to learn Python; it's a community of amazing women where I get my inspiration and motivation to code. Learning and helping other women to code has ignited a spark within me. I am more empowered to use the languages I've learned at work and outside at tech events because of it."

      "Having the opportunity to coach new students on the classes I've already taken has been a huge help for me both in terms of reviewing what I know and also developing my ability to communicate technical concepts. I think the format really fosters the type of long-term commitment necessary to really master a programming language."

      "I had never considered coding as a hobby or career option -- now I can see both in my future. Even if I had wanted to learn, there was no community or mentor available to me, no space where I felt comfortable and enthusiastic to learn. Shannon, her coaches, and all my female classmates are building a community of women who support and encourage each other."

      "Right from the start, she pushed us to help each other and look to each other for assistance -- I remember how she explained to me how to test my installation, and then a few minutes later, when a neighbor asked the same question, she said, 'Alison can show you how to do that.'  Everyone at our table was comparing screens and checking in with each other for the rest of the session."
