      "Having the opportunity to coach new students on the classes I've already taken has been a huge help for me both in terms of reviewing what I know and also developing my ability to communicate technical concepts.

      "I had never considered coding as a hobby or career option -- now I can see both in my future. Even if I had wanted to learn, there was no community or mentor available to me, no space where I felt comfortable and enthusiastic to learn. Shannon, her coaches, and all my female classmates are building a community of women who support and encourage each other."

      "Right from the start, she pushed us to help each other and look to each other for assistance -- I remember how she explained to me how to test my installation, and then a few minutes later, when a neighbor asked the same question, she said, 'Alison can show you how to do that.'  Everyone at our table was comparing screens and checking in with each other for the rest of the session."
